<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This report analyzes NYC payroll data to evaluate potential policies aimed at reducing taxpayer expenses. We examine three policies:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Capping salaries at the mayoral level</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Increasing staffing to reduce overtime</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>A custom policy proposal</strong></p>
<p>The analysis is based on historical payroll data, and all calculations are made using standardized assumptions.</p>

<li>Agencies with the highest OT-to-salary ratios should prioritize hiring over paying OT.</li>
<li>Job roles with excessive OT hours (e.g., NYPD, FDNY, sanitation workers) should be assessed for staffing shortages.</li>
